## A. Chessboard

A program that creates a string that represents an 8x8 grid, 
using newline characters to separate lines. 
At each position of the grid there is either a space or a “#” character. 
The characters should form a chessboard.

## B. ShamsTIIDELAB
A program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 200, with two exceptions.
- For numbers divisible by 6, print "Shams" instead of the number, and 
- For numbers divisible by 8 (and not 6), print "TIIDELAB" instead. 

Then modified to print "ShamsTIIDELAB" for numbers that are divisible by both 6 and 8 (and still print "Shams" or "TIIDELAB" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
